    <h2>Today, we're learning about HTML (How To Make Lumpia)</h2>
    <p>
        Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian cuisines. The rolls 
        traditionally wrapped and rolled individually in thin flour sheets known as lumpia wrappers. These 
        are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground pork and vegetables. Each piece of lumpia is deep
        fried until golden brown. This makes it crunchy and more enjoyable to eat. It is served with either
        sweet and sour sauce or with banana ketchup.

        Lumpia is a popular dish in the Philippines. It is served during special occasions. Christmas dinner 
        won't be complete without this on the table. It is also a popular part of the menu during town fiestas, 
        birthday parties, weddings, and Christmas.
