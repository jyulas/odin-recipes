    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pork Afritada is a classic Filipino stew made with pork, potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers simmered 
        in a tomato-based sauce. It's similar to other Filipino tomato-based stews like menudo or mechado, but 
        each has its own twist. Afritada is usually less complex, focusing more on the sweetness of tomatoes 
        and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best side dish for Afritada is rice. A cup of warm white rice is enough to enjoy it and find your
        meal more appetizing when you poured the sauce over the rice.
