    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy Pininyahang Manok is a Filipino chicken dish made rich and flavorful with pineapple, 
        vegetables, and creamer. The perfect comfort food to enjoy with hot steamed rice.
    </p>
    <p>The dish highlights the sweetness of pineapple blended with the savoriness of chicken and vegetables.
        The addition of creamer gives it a smooth, rich texture that makes it different from the traditional 
        pininyahang manok cooked without dairy.
